# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      ENVIRONMENT SETUP:
      - Supabase credentials configured (URL, Service Key, Anon Key)
      - Emergent LLM Key configured for AI features
      - Backend running on port 8001
      - Frontend built and running on port 3000
      - Fixed ReactPlayer TypeScript compilation issue
      
      TECHNICAL NOTES:
      - All stat cards calculate real data from Supabase (enrollments, progress, quizzes, activities)
      - Profile photo uploads to Supabase storage 'profile-photos' bucket
      - AI Insights tab includes fallback data if AI service is unavailable
      - Recent Activity tab queries progress table and displays activity history

      NEW TASK COMPLETED - Merged AI Recommendations and Learning Path Features:
      
      ‚úÖ MERGE COMPLETED:
      1. Combined both features into a single unified page at /dashboard/ai-recommendations
      2. Created tab interface with two tabs:
         - "Course Recommendations" - Shows AI-powered personalized course recommendations with match scores and reasons
         - "Learning Path Generator" - Allows users to input learning goals and generates custom learning paths with milestones
      
      ‚úÖ SIDEBAR UPDATED:
      - Removed duplicate "Learning Path" link
      - Renamed "AI Recommendations" to "AI Learning" 
      - Changed icon from Sparkles to Brain for better representation
      - Consolidated navigation - single entry point for both features
      
      ‚úÖ CODE CLEANUP:
      - Deleted old /dashboard/learning-path directory
      - All functionality preserved and merged into ai-recommendations page
      - Both backend API endpoints still functional (/ai/recommend-courses and /ai/learning-path)
      
      ‚úÖ TESTING:
      - Application successfully restarted with Supabase and Emergent LLM credentials
      - Landing page loads correctly
      - Authentication working properly (redirects to login when accessing protected routes)
      - Backend and frontend both running without errors
      
      The merge eliminates redundancy while maintaining all functionality. Users can now access both course recommendations and learning path generation from a single "AI Learning" page with an intuitive tab interface.

         - SUPABASE_URL
         - SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
         - EMERGENT_LLM_KEY (fetched automatically)
      4. Updated frontend/.env with:
         - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
         - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
         - NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL
      5. Restarted both backend and frontend services
